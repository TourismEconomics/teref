This package provides reference tables, such as showing the correspondence between country and city names and codes across different databases and sources. This package contains three reference tables:  

* __cb_ctry:__ Country names and codes across databases.  
* __cb_city:__ City names and codes across databases.
* __cb_ctry_oegtc:__ Country names, codes and regions used in the Global City Travel database.
* __cb_var_oegc:__ Variable codes and descriptions to use with the Global Cities database. 
* __cb_var_oegtc:__ Variable codes and descriptions to use with the Global City Travel database.

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TourismEconomics/teref")
```

## Organization
The tables, or code books, are stored as Rdata files in the "data" directory. 


## Suggestions

When using the cb_ctry or the cb_city with the Global Cities database, it is advisable to join based on the oegc_loc_code, rather than the location name, because some city-country situations have the same location name (e.g. Singapore, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Macao).
