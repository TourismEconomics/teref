* __ctry_code_book:__ Country names and codes across databases. 
* __city_code_book:__ City names and codes across databases.
* __ctry_code_book_oegtc:__ Country names, codes and regions used in the Global City Travel database.
* __var_code_book_oegtc:__ Variable codes and descriptions to use with the Global City Travel database.

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
