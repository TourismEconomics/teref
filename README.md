<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of teref is to provide certain reference tables, such as
showing the correspondence between country and city names and codes
across different databases and sources. This package contains three
reference tables: \* **ctry\_code\_book:** Country names and codes
across databases. \* **city\_code\_book:** City names and codes across
databases. \* **var\_code\_book\_oegtc:** Variable codes and
descriptions to use with the Global City Travel database.

## Installation

You can install the package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TourismEconomics/teref")
```

## Organization

The tables, or code books, are stored as Rdata files in the “data”
directory.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
#library(teref)
## basic example code
```
